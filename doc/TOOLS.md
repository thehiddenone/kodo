# Kōdo Tools — How Agent Tools Work, End to End

> How a tool goes from a static specification, to something an LLM can see and
> call, to executed Python, and back to the model as a result — and how every
> piece is wired together.

This document is the companion to [INTERNALS.md §6/§6A/§12](INTERNALS.md). It
covers the **tool subsystem** specifically: the split between a tool's
*specification* and its *implementation*, the dispatch machinery, and the full
request/response lifecycle through the LLM.

---

## 1. The two halves of a tool

Every tool is two things living in two packages:

| Half | Package | What it is | Example file |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Specification** (`ToolSpec`) | `kodo.toolspecs` | Pure data: the tool's name, the JSON Schema for its inputs, the description the model reads, and prompt-rendering metadata. No logic. | [_finalize_project.py](../src/kodo/toolspecs/_finalize_project.py) |
| **Implementation** (`Tool` subclass) | `kodo.tools` | One `Tool` subclass whose `handle(self, tool_input) -> str` does the work and returns a JSON string, reading collaborators off `self.context`. | [_finalize_project.py](../src/kodo/tools/_finalize_project.py) |

There is **one module per tool in each package**, and they share the tool's
short name (`finalize_project`). The two are bound together in exactly one
place — the dispatch table in [tools/_dispatch.py](../src/kodo/tools/_dispatch.py)
— so adding a tool is "add a spec, add a `Tool` subclass, add one row."

> **Why split them?** The spec is consumed by two unrelated readers: the LLM
> (which needs the schema + description) and the prompt renderer (which needs
> the human-facing metadata). The handler is consumed by the dispatcher. Keeping
> the spec as inert data lets `subagents` and `llms` depend on the catalog
> without dragging in dispatch logic (gates, `guided_state`, the engine).

---

## 2. The layering — where `kodo.tools` sits

`kodo.tools` is a dedicated import tier **between** `toolspecs` (T2) and
`subagents`/`llms` (T3):

```text
 T4  runtime              ← builds a ToolDispatcher per agent run; injects collaborators
        │  imports
        ▼
 T3  subagents · llms · tools      ← tools may import only ↓; imported only by runtime
        │
        ▼
 T2  toolspecs · security ← the ToolSpec catalog (pure data) and the security
        │                    layer over it (kodo.security → toolspecs + shellparser;
        ▼                    consumed only by runtime — doc/SECURITY.md)
 T1  transport
        │
        ▼
 T0  common · project · guided_state · state · websearch
```

**Hard rule:** `kodo.tools` may import only from T0/T1/T2 — in practice
`kodo.guided_state`, `kodo.project`, `kodo.websearch` (the Playwright- and
`curl_cffi`-backed fetch engine behind `query_search_engine`/`web_search` —
doc/WEB_SEARCH.md — and the single-page fetch behind `read_webpage` —
doc/READ_WEBPAGE.md), and
`kodo.toolspecs`. It must **never**
import `subagents`, `llms`, or `runtime`. The collaborators it needs from
higher tiers (the gate, the session, every engine-side operation) are
inverted into **structural Protocols** defined inside `tools` and injected by
`runtime` (see §5). Verify the ceiling:

```bash
grep -rE "^\s*(from|import) kodo\.(subagents|llms|runtime|server)" src/kodo/tools   # must be empty
```

---

## 3. Anatomy of a `ToolSpec`

[toolspecs/_spec.py](../src/kodo/toolspecs/_spec.py) defines the frozen
dataclass. Using `finalize_project` as the example:

```python
FINALIZE_PROJECT: ToolSpec = ToolSpec(
    name="finalize_project",              # the model calls the tool by this name
    external_name="Finalize Project",     # human label for prompt heading + UI
    user_description="Mark the project as done",   # short UI label for tool-call events
    description=(                          # what the MODEL reads to decide to call it
        "Terminal call: the project is complete.  "
        "Transitions state.phase to 'done' and ends the Guide session."
    ),
    input_schema={"type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": []},  # JSON Schema
    when_to_use=(                          # rendered into the agent's `## Tools` prompt
        "All product-level stages have completed and no tracked document is "
        "left pending — the project is done.",
    ),
    autonomous_mode=None,                  # per-mode behavior (see §8)
)
```

Crucially, **not all fields reach the LLM the same way:**

- `name`, `description`, `input_schema` → sent to the model **as a tool
  definition** (the API `tools` parameter — see §6).
- `external_name`, `when_to_use`, `autonomous_mode` → rendered into the
  **system prompt's `## Tools` section** by the agent registry (see §7).
- `user_description` → used only for **UI events** (`agent.tool_call`), never
  seen by the model.

---

## 4. Wiring: how a `Tool` class is bound to a `ToolSpec`

A tool is a subclass of the `Tool` ABC ([tools/_tool.py](../src/kodo/tools/_tool.py))
with a fixed shape, e.g.
[tools/_finalize_project.py](../src/kodo/tools/_finalize_project.py):

```python
class FinalizeProjectTool(Tool):
    async def handle(self, tool_input: dict[str, object]) -> str:
        self.context.session.phase = "done"
        return json.dumps({"status": "done"})
```

The `Tool` base binds the run's context and exposes it read-only:

```python
class Tool(ABC):
    def __init__(self, context: ToolContext) -> None:
        self.__context = context            # name-mangled → _Tool__context

    @property
    def context(self) -> ToolContext:       # subclasses read collaborators here
        return self.__context

    @abstractmethod
    async def handle(self, tool_input: dict[str, object]) -> str: ...
```

> Subclasses read the context through `self.context`, **not** `self.__context` —
> the latter would name-mangle to `_<Subclass>__context` and miss the base's
> `_Tool__context`. This is the project's standard private-member-plus-read-only-property
> pattern.

The binding happens in **one table** in
[tools/_dispatch.py](../src/kodo/tools/_dispatch.py) — the single source of
truth pairing each dispatchable `ToolSpec` with its `Tool` subclass:

```python
_TOOL_CLASSES: tuple[tuple[ToolSpec, type[Tool]], ...] = (
    (READ_FILE,           ReadFileTool),
    (DOCUMENT_FEEDBACK,   DocumentFeedbackTool),
    (ASK_USER,            AskUserTool),
    ...
    (FINALIZE_PROJECT,    FinalizeProjectTool),
)
```

From that table, two lookups are derived:

```python
# name → Tool subclass   (used at dispatch time)
_CLASSES_BY_NAME: dict[str, type[Tool]] = {spec.name: cls for spec, cls in _TOOL_CLASSES}

# name → spec            (used to build the LLM-facing tool list for an agent)
DISPATCHABLE_TOOLS_BY_NAME: dict[str, ToolSpec] = {spec.name: spec for spec, _ in _TOOL_CLASSES}
```

So a `ToolSpec` and its `Tool` class are connected **only** through their shared
`name` plus this one `_TOOL_CLASSES` row. There is no decorator registry, no
import-time side effect, no name-string magic scattered around — adding a row is
the entire wiring step.

> A spec with **no** row here is "spec only": it can be rendered into a prompt
> but is silently dropped from the LLM-facing tool list, because
> `tools_for_agent` (§7) only returns specs present in
> `DISPATCHABLE_TOOLS_BY_NAME`. There are no such placeholders today — every
> spec in the catalog has a dispatch row, including `toolchain_build`/
> `toolchain_deps`, which used to be spec-only. `filesystem` is one row:
> a single `FilesystemTool` dispatches its six directory/delete/copy/move
> operations on its `operation` field; `create_file` (whole-file creation),
> `create_directory` (directory creation), and `edit_file` (targeted
> existing-file edit) are separate tools, as is the read-only `read_file`
> (whole file, line ranges, or a regex `pattern` with context lines).

---

## 5. What a tool reads: `ToolContext` + Protocols

Each `Tool` instance is constructed with one `ToolContext`
([tools/_context.py](../src/kodo/tools/_context.py)) and reads it through
`self.context`. The context carries the collaborators a tool might need **plus**
the per-run mutable state, and it is the seam that keeps `tools` from importing
`runtime`.

```python
@dataclass
class ToolContext:
    resolver: PathResolver        # T0 — project-confined or logical path resolution
    gate: GateLike                # Protocol — ask_user / approval gates (impl in runtime)
    session: SessionLike          # Protocol — .phase (finalize) + .effective_autonomous
    services: EngineServices      # Protocol — every engine-side op a tool can trigger
    agent_name: str               # the running agent (jsonl author/reviewer field)
    session_id: str
    mode: str = "problem_solving" # "guided" | "problem_solving" — frozen per prompt
    project_root: Path | None = None  # the bound project's root, if any
    stop_requested: bool = False                             # set by escalate_blocker
    returned_output: dict[str, object] | None = None         # set by return_result
```

Note what is **not** here: there is no `autonomous` field. The mode a handler
honours is read live from `session.effective_autonomous` (frozen per prompt by
the engine — see §8), so no per-run snapshot can drift from the session.

The three things a tool needs from *above* its tier are **structural
Protocols**, also defined in `_context.py`:

- **`GateLike`** — `fire_questions(questions, tool_call_id)` /
  `fire_approval(...)`. Runtime's
  [`GateOrchestrator`](../src/kodo/runtime/_gates.py) satisfies it by shape (no
  inheritance). `fire_questions` takes one `ask_user` batch
  (`{question, kind, options}` per entry) plus the calling `tool_use` id
  (read from `ToolContext.current_tool_use_id`, set by the dispatcher before
  each call) and returns one `{selected, free_text}` answer per question;
  approvals return an object satisfying the read-only `ApprovalLike` protocol.
- **`SessionLike`** — a settable `phase: str` plus a read `effective_autonomous:
  bool`. Runtime's `SessionState` matches.
- **`EngineServices`** — **one** protocol covering *every* engine-side operation
  a tool can delegate upward: `run_subagent(caller, ...)`,
  `run_dependency_manager(task_input)` (ungated `toolchain_depsmgr` spawn for
  `toolchain_deps`), `run_web_search_agent(task_input)` (ungated *silent,
  multi-round tool-calling* `web_search` agent turn — no subsession, since
  `web_search` is typically called from a sub-agent; doc/WEB_SEARCH.md),
  `run_author_critic_iteration(caller, ...,
  path, input_paths, instructions,
  for_revision)`, `rollback(...)`, `disable_autonomous_mode(...)`, and
  `create_project(name)`. Runtime injects a single `_EngineServices` adapter
  (built inline in `runtime/_engine/`) wrapping the engine's private `_run_*` /
  `_disable_autonomous` / `_create_project` methods. There is deliberately
  **no** `complete_artifact`-style method: the accept/review flow
  (`_finalize_document`) is purely engine-internal, triggered from a
  post-dispatch hook after a `document_feedback` call — never through a tool
  or a protocol indirection. `create_project` is what backs the
  `create_new_project` tool: the engine slugifies the requested name, makes a
  fresh directory under the session workspace root (auto-suffixing on
  collision), scaffolds its `.kodo/`+mirror via `RootMirrorManager.prepare`,
  and pushes `EVT_WORKSPACE_ADD_FOLDER` so the extension adds it to the open
  VS Code workspace.

This is the dependency inversion that lets the tool layer sit *below* the engine
while still calling back into it. `runtime` constructs the concrete objects and
hands them in; `tools` only ever names the Protocols. A handler reaches an engine
op as, e.g., `await self.context.services.run_subagent(self.context.agent_name, ...)`.
The spawning tools pass `self.context.agent_name` (the **running** agent — not a
hard-coded guide) as the `caller`; the engine gates the spawn against that
caller's frontmatter `subagents:` allow-list and raises `PermissionError` (which
the tool returns to the LLM as `{"error": ...}`) when the target is not permitted.

Per-run state lives on the context, not on the tool instance:
`ReturnResultTool` sets `self.context.returned_output`,
`EscalateBlockerTool` sets `self.context.stop_requested`. The dispatcher exposes
both back to the engine after the run.

---

## 5a. The `temporary` argument: session-scoped scratch files

Six file tools — `create_file`, `create_directory`, `edit_file`,
`filesystem`, `find_files`, `find_text_in_files` — accept an optional
`temporary: true` input alongside their usual `path`/`root`/`source`/
`destination` arguments. Every one of them resolves its path(s) through the
shared `Tool.resolve_path(path, *, temporary=...)` helper
([tools/_tool.py](../src/kodo/tools/_tool.py)) instead of calling
`self.context.resolver.resolve(...)` directly:

```python
def resolve_path(self, path: str, *, temporary: bool = False) -> Path:
    if temporary:
        return resolve_within(session_temp_dir(self.context.session_id), path)
    return self.context.resolver.resolve(path)
```

`session_temp_dir(session_id)` ([project/_layout.py](../src/kodo/project/_layout.py))
is `~/.kodo/sessions/<session_id>/tmp` — one scratch directory per session,
outside every project root and workspace folder. `resolve_within` (the same
helper Guided mode uses to confine paths to the project root) confines
relative paths inside it and rejects absolute paths that would escape it,
exactly like the ordinary resolver — a `temporary` call gets no *less*
containment, just a different root.

This is a **tool-level** mechanism, not a `ToolContext`/resolver change: the
active `PathResolver` (Guided or Problem Solver) is untouched, and a call
without `temporary` behaves exactly as before. Two other layers special-case
the same flag:

- **Security** ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) §3.0a) — a `temporary: true` call
  on one of the six tools is always allowed, in every Command Control
  posture, before the usual impact/threshold judgement runs.
- **Checkpointing** — `CheckpointCoordinator.prepare` (§10 below) skips its
  mirror snapshot/commit outright for a `temporary` call, so nothing written
  there ever earns a checkpoint, an undo/rollback entry, or a Guided
  `new_revision` attribution.

Agents are told when to reach for this in `preamble_performance.md`'s
"Scratch / Temporary Work" section: throwaway notes, intermediate files, and
working copies that should never land in the project.

**Discovering the directory itself.** `get_root_paths` also takes an optional
`temporary: true` input ([toolspecs/_get_root_paths.py](../src/kodo/toolspecs/_get_root_paths.py),
[tools/_get_root_paths.py](../src/kodo/tools/_get_root_paths.py)). Instead of
the usual per-project root list it returns one `{"name": "scratch", "path":
...}` entry for `session_temp_dir(self.context.session_id)` (created eagerly
via `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` so the path is guaranteed to exist).
This is how an agent gets the scratch directory's *absolute path* — e.g. to
pass as `run_command`'s `working_dir`, which the Guided-mode resolver also
special-cases: `ProjectPathResolver` accepts an `extra_roots` tuple
(`kodo/tools/_paths.py`), and the engine's `_make_resolver(session_id)`
(`kodo/runtime/_engine/_core.py`) passes `session_temp_dir(session_id)` as
that run's one extra root — the *same* `session_id` its `ToolContext` (and
thus its own `temporary: true` file-tool calls) uses, so a leaf sub-agent's
`run_command` reaches its own subsession scratch directory, not the
orchestrator's. Problem Solver's logical resolver already allows any absolute
path, so it needed no equivalent change.

---

## 6. How tools reach the LLM, and how a call comes back

Tools are passed to the model **as a separate API parameter**, never embedded in
the message text. In [llms/anthropic/_claude.py](../src/kodo/llms/anthropic/_claude.py),
each `ToolSpec` is converted to an Anthropic tool definition:

```python
tool_defs = [
    {"name": t.name, "description": t.description, "input_schema": t.input_schema}
    for t in tools
]
...
self.__client.messages.stream(model=..., system=..., messages=..., tools=tool_defs)
```

Only **three** spec fields cross the wire to the model: `name`, `description`,
`input_schema`. When the model decides to use a tool, it emits a `tool_use`
content block, which the plugin assembles into a provider-agnostic
[`ToolCallEvent`](../src/kodo/llms/_interface.py):

```python
ToolCallEvent(tool_use_id="toolu_…", tool_name="finalize_project", tool_input={...})
```

> Both providers (Anthropic and llama.cpp) are **stateless**: the `tools` list
> is re-sent on every `stream_query` call. The model has no memory of prior tool
> definitions — only the `messages` array (with `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks)
> carries history.

---

## 7. Which tools an agent gets: frontmatter → `tools_for_agent`

There is **one unified tool surface** — no guide-vs-leaf split. Every
agent (the guide included) is granted exactly the tools its frontmatter
`tools:` list declares. Two consumers turn that list into reality:

**(a) The LLM-facing tool list.** The engine calls
[`tools_for_agent(agent.tools)`](../src/kodo/tools/_dispatch.py):

```python
def tools_for_agent(tool_names: frozenset[str]) -> list[ToolSpec]:
    return [DISPATCHABLE_TOOLS_BY_NAME[n] for n in tool_names if n in DISPATCHABLE_TOOLS_BY_NAME]
```

It takes **tool names** (`frozenset[str]`), not a `SubAgent` — that would be an
upward import into T3. Names with no handler are skipped.

**(b) The prompt `## Tools` section.** Independently,
[subagents/_registry.py](../src/kodo/subagents/_registry.py) renders each
declared tool's `external_name` + `when_to_use` + `autonomous_mode` into the
agent's system prompt (replacing a `{PLACEHOLDER:TOOLS}` token), from
`ALL_TOOLS`. The model thus reads *narrative guidance* in the system prompt and
*callable schemas* via the API `tools` parameter — two views of the same spec.

---

## 8. Autonomous mode

Filtering for autonomous mode happens **once**, in the agent registry — not in
the tool layer. A spec whose `autonomous_mode` contains `"unavailable"` (today
only `ask_user`) is dropped from both the agent's `.tools` set **and** its
rendered `## Tools` section when `registry.get(name, autonomous=True)` is called.
Because the engine builds the LLM tool list from the *already-filtered*
`agent.tools`, the withheld tool simply never reaches the model.

A tool can also declare `autonomous_mode="auto-accepted …"` for a spec whose
*handler* short-circuits on `ctx.session.effective_autonomous` and synthesizes
its response instead of blocking on the gate — no tool does today, since the
one example (the former `request_user_review_artifact`) moved into the
engine: `_finalize_document` (triggered after `document_feedback`, not a
dispatched tool) checks `effective_autonomous` itself and either auto-accepts
or fires the gate. The mechanism remains available for a future tool that
needs it.

> **Where `effective_autonomous` comes from.** The user-facing toggle sets
> `SessionState.autonomous`, but the engine *freezes* that into
> `effective_autonomous` once per prompt (when the worker dequeues it), so a
> mid-prompt toggle never splits a running prompt's mode. Every tool and the
> registry read `effective_autonomous`; the dispatcher therefore needs no
> `autonomous` argument at all.

---

## 8A. The `intent` parameter — mutating tools declare their purpose

Every **first-degree mutator** — a tool whose own dispatch changes content on
disk: `filesystem`, `edit_file`, `create_file`, `create_directory`,
`run_command`, `create_new_project`, `rollback` — declares a mandatory
`intent` string as the **first** property of its `input_schema`: one sentence
stating what this specific call changes and why. The property (and the generic "how to state
your intent" guidance the model reads) is defined **once**, in
[toolspecs/_intent.py](../src/kodo/toolspecs/_intent.py) (`INTENT_PROPERTY`),
and embedded by each mutating spec, so the instructions can never drift
between tools.

- **Exempt:** tools that mutate only *through other agents* —
  `run_subagent`, `run_author_critic_iteration`, `toolchain_deps` — because
  the spawned agent's own first-degree calls carry their own intents;
  `toolchain_build` (it only executes the project's generated build scripts);
  and everything read-only or session-state-only.
- **Enforcement:** `ToolDispatcher.dispatch` generically rejects a call to any
  spec that requires `intent` (`requires_intent(spec)`) when the field is
  missing or blank — the handler never runs; the model gets an `{"error": …}`
  telling it to state the intent and retry.
- **Visibility:** `intent` is declared `"always"` visible and, as the first
  schema property, renders as the top row of the WebView's tool-call detail
  box.
- **Consumer:** the security layer ([doc/SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). In SMART
  Command Control every HIGH-impact call goes through a one-shot LLM *intent
  judge* that matches the declared intent against the parameters: a clean
  match on a benign step auto-allows; anything else asks the user via
  `prompt.permission`. `run_command` is additionally analyzed statically
  first — a target provably outside the workspace always asks, a provably
  read-only in-workspace command always passes.

---

## 9. The dispatcher

[`ToolDispatcher`](../src/kodo/tools/_dispatch.py) is built **once per agent
run** by the engine. It owns the run's `ToolContext` and routes calls:

```python
class ToolDispatcher:
    def __init__(self, *, resolver, gate, session, services,
                 agent_name, session_id, security=None,
                 mode="problem_solving", project_root=None):
        self.__ctx = ToolContext(...)            # one context for the whole run

    @property
    def stop_requested(self) -> bool: ...        # read by the engine after each tool batch
    @property
    def returned_output(self) -> dict[str, object] | None: ...   # set by return_result

    async def dispatch(self, tool_name, tool_input, tool_use_id="") -> str:
        tool_cls = _CLASSES_BY_NAME.get(tool_name)
        if tool_cls is None:
            return json.dumps({"error": f"Unknown tool: {tool_name!r}"})
        # 1. intent presence (§8A)   2. security gate (doc/SECURITY.md)
        denial = await self.__security_gate(tool_name, tool_input, tool_use_id)
        if denial is not None:
            return denial                        # user denied — handler never runs
        return await tool_cls(self.__ctx).handle(tool_input)   # bind context, then run
```

`dispatch` is the single function the engine passes into its turn loop as the
`tool_dispatch` callback. Two generic gates run before the handler: a spec
that requires `intent` (§8A) never dispatches without a non-blank one, and the
**security layer** judges every call — an `ask` verdict fires the
`prompt.permission` gate and a user denial returns an error result without
executing the tool (doc/SECURITY.md). It then instantiates the matching
`Tool` subclass bound to this run's context and calls its `handle`. Whether
the caller is the guide or a leaf sub-agent, the routing is identical — only
the *contents* of the context and the *set* of tools differ.

---

## 10. The engine turn loop — putting it together

[runtime/_engine/](../src/kodo/runtime/_engine/) drives the generic loop
(`_run_agent_turn`), shared by the guide and every leaf agent. Per run:

1. Resolve the agent (`registry.get(name, autonomous)`), which yields its
   filtered `tools` and rendered system prompt.
2. Build the dispatcher: `dispatcher = self._make_dispatcher(agent_name, session_id)`
   — injecting the gate, session, the single `_EngineServices` adapter, and
   `mode`/`project_root` (read live from the current workflow mode and bound
   project, independent of each other — a Problem-Solver run still carries
   `project_root` if a project happens to be bound). No `autonomous` flag is
   passed; tools read `session.effective_autonomous`.
3. Call `_run_agent_turn(..., tools=tools_for_agent(agent.tools),
   tool_dispatch=dispatcher.dispatch, stop_after_tools=lambda: dispatcher.stop_requested)`.

Inside the loop:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ while True:                                                             │
│   stream = llm.stream_query(system, messages, tools=<ToolSpec list>)   │
│   collect TokenDelta → text, ToolCallEvent → tool_calls, TurnEnd       │
│                                                                        │
│   if no tool_calls:  append assistant text to messages; BREAK          │
│                                                                        │
│   append assistant message (text + tool_use blocks) to messages        │
│   for each tool call:                                                   │
│       emit EVT_AGENT_TOOL_CALL  (UI: name + user_description)           │
│       result_text = await tool_dispatch(name, input)   ← ToolDispatcher │

```

So the handler's returned **JSON string becomes the `content` of a
`tool_result` block**, fed back to the model on the next iteration. The model
reads it, reasons, and either calls more tools or ends its turn. After the loop,
the engine reads `dispatcher.returned_output` (what a leaf returned via
`return_result`) and used `dispatcher.stop_requested` to decide early exit. A
mutating tool call (`filesystem`/`edit_file`/`create_file`/`create_directory`) is additionally bracketed by
`CheckpointCoordinator.prepare`/`CheckpointCoordinator.commit` (§12.1 in INTERNALS.md) — outside
this loop, around the `tool_dispatch` call — so every dispatch in this diagram
that touches a file also earns a mirror commit. The one exception: a call
made with `temporary: true` (§5a) is skipped by `prepare` outright and never
earns one, since it never touches the project at all.

author that writes a file:

```

The gate-backed tools (`ask_user`, `escalate_blocker`) follow the same path
but their handler `await`s `ctx.gate.fire_*`, which sends a `kind=request`
frame to the VS Code client and
blocks on a future until the user responds — see
[INTERNALS.md §15 "User gate"](INTERNALS.md).

`ask_user` carries a **question batch** — every open question about the
agent's current topic in one call, each with the candidate answers the agent
derived itself (top choice first; the client appends the free-text option, so
specs never include an "Other"). The discipline lives in
`preamble_performance.md` ("Asking the User Questions"), shared by every
agent, not in per-agent prompts. The client renders the batch as an
interactive **in-feed question panel** rather than a tool-call card (the
engine suppresses `agent.tool_call`/`agent.tool_call_detail` for `ask_user`):
the user navigates the boxes, revises selections freely, and answers land
only on *Confirm and Send*. The confirmed panel freezes read-only and is
rebuilt after a reload purely from the persisted `tool_use` (questions) +
`tool_result` (answers) — only the tool call and its result ever reach LLM
context. A crash mid-answer re-drives the whole batch (SESSIONS.md);
`escalate_blocker`'s interactive prompt rides the same gate as a single
free-text-only question (`options: []`).

## 12. Adding a new tool — checklist

1. **Spec** — create `src/kodo/toolspecs/_<tool_name>.py` exporting one
   `ToolSpec` (with `input_schema`, a model-facing `description`, generic
   `when_to_use` bullets, optional `autonomous_mode`). Add it to
   `toolspecs/__init__.py` imports / `__all__` / `ALL_TOOLS`. If the tool
   mutates content directly (a first-degree mutator, §8A), embed
   `INTENT_PROPERTY` from `toolspecs/_intent.py` as the **first**
   `input_schema` property, list `intent` first in `required`, and mark it
   `"always"` in `input_visibility` — the dispatcher's enforcement keys on
   the `required` entry.
2. **Tool class** — create `src/kodo/tools/_<tool_name>.py` with a
   `class <Name>Tool(Tool)` implementing
   `async def handle(self, tool_input: dict[str, object]) -> str`.
   Read collaborators via `self.context`; return a JSON string.
3. **Wire** — add one `(SPEC, <Name>Tool)` row to `_TOOL_CLASSES` in
   [tools/_dispatch.py](../src/kodo/tools/_dispatch.py), and export the class
   from `tools/__init__.py`. (The row is the *only* binding step — both
   `_CLASSES_BY_NAME` and `DISPATCHABLE_TOOLS_BY_NAME` derive from it.)
4. **Grant** — add the tool name to the relevant agent's frontmatter `tools:`
   list in `src/kodo/subagents/subagent_<agent>.md`.
5. If the handler needs a new collaborator from above its tier, add a **Protocol**
   to `tools/_context.py` and a field to `ToolContext`; inject the concrete
   implementation from the engine's `_make_dispatcher`.

Do **not** import `subagents`, `llms`, or `runtime` from the handler.
